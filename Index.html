                <p><em>The Straw Hat Pirates</em>, also known as <strong>Mugiwara Kaizokudan</strong>, Straw Hat Crew or simply the Straw Hats, are a very infamous and powerful pirate crew that originated from the East Blue.</p>
                <p>The "Straw Hats" are named after Luffy's signature hat that was given to him by <em>"Red-Haired Shanks</em> and are first referred to as the Straw Hat Pirates by Smoker in the Alabasta Kingdom. The crew sailed on the Going Merry, their first official Straw Hat ship, up until the Water 7 Arc. During the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Franky and Iceburg built them a new ship which was named the Thousand Sunny by Iceburg, even though the members fought over different names.</p>
